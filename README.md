Cash App is owned by Block, Inc. (SQ) (formerly Square, Inc.), a leader in the financial technology industry. Cash App is just one part of Block's business offerings, which also include software and point-of-sale hardware for businesses of all sizes as well as cryptocurrency services.

Since going public in November 2015, the company has quickly grown into one of the largest payment processing companies in the United States and has expanded its business model beyond payment processing to include enterprise offerings such as scheduling, employee management, and business analytics.


Block (Square at the time) launched its Cash App service in 2013 to compete with services like Venmo, Paypal, and Apple Pay. Such peer-to-peer (P2P) payment services allow consumers to use their smartphones to pay for goods and services, pay bills, and transfer money to friends and family.

Cash App has expanded its functionality beyond just a peer-to-peer payment service; users can also receive direct deposit payments and ACH payments, as well as purchase cryptocurrency through the platform. More recently, Cash App introduced an investing feature called Investing that allows users to trade stocks and ETFs commission-free within the application.

In 2018, Cash App surpassed Venmo in downloads, with 33.5 million cumulative downloads. As of September 2023, Cash App had 55 million monthly transacting activities. Venmo has about 90 million active users.

Cash App makes money by charging businesses and individuals transaction fees, from subscription services, and selling Bitcoin to customers.

Businesses and users are charged various fees, for instance, instant money withdrawals (instead of the typical two- to three-day transfers, which remain free) cost 0.5% to 1.75% of the value transferred out. Sending from a credit card will also be subject to a 3% fee.

The Bitcoin segment of Cash App's business is its largest revenue generator. In addition to a service fee charged for selling Bitcoin to its customers, there is generally a 1% to 4% difference in what Bitcoin exchanges and individuals pay for Bitcoin. Cash App factors these differences into the prices it offers its users, generating additional revenue on the exchanges it facilitates.

Square, Inc. changed its official name to Block, Inc. in Dec. 2021. It retained the same stock ticker symbol, "SQ." The Square brand name will continue to be associated with the company's Seller business, which provides an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers. The Block brand will focus on the consumer side, in an effort to grant economic empowerment to individuals, artists, fans, developers, and sellers.

Cash App is a subsidiary of Block, Inc., which reports revenues based on its three business segments: Cash App, Square, and Corporate and Other. Cash App reports revenue in three segments: transactions, subscriptions and services, and Bitcoin.

For its third quarter fiscal year (FY) 2023, for the period ending Sept. 30, 2023, Cash App brought in revenues of $3.58 billion; an increase of 33.5% year-over-year (YOY). The Cash App segment reported a gross profit of $983.86 million; a 27% YOY increase.

Revenue grew in all segments. Transaction-based revenue grew due to growth in Cash App Business gross payment volume (GPV), primarily driven by peer-to-peer transactions received by business accounts and peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card. Subscription services revenue grew due to growth in Cash App's financial service-related products, including Cash App Card usage, Cash App Instant Deposit volumes, as well as interest earned on customer funds. Bitcoin revenue grew due to the increase in the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers.
